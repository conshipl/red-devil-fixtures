My final project for Computing I course at IUPUI.

It is a Flask app that displays soccer fixtures (matches, games, whatever you’d like to call them) for a selected date. The application defaults to today’s date in UTC and then allows the user to select the date via calendar, and it shows current season fixtures for 8 top-flight competitions across Europe (Bundesliga, Eredivisie, Primera Division, Primeira Liga, English Championship and Premier League, Ligue 1, and Serie A) and the Brasileiro Serie A in Brazil. Information for each match includes the teams playing and their club crests, the venue of the match (home team’s stadium name), the time of the match (UTC), and where to watch the match (the channel/app). There's also a Standings page that shows the current standings for each league, but as the database hasn't been updated in quite some time, it's no longer accurate.
